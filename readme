Other Notes:	
==========================
	Deploy keys : repo and server can directly talk without account login



Doubts:
==========================
1. We know how to commit modified files into remote repo. 
   But if we make changes directly to the remote repo, s.t. the local repo and remote 
   repo code is not same, how can we sync the remote repo changes?


===========================
himanshusetia@himanshu0811:~/gitty/gitty$ git status -s
 M readme
?? dummy2

// dummy2 was not added even once so "??"
===========================
===========================


	git reset --hard <<branch name>>        // reset back to HEAD





Common git errors:
=========================
1. himanshusetia@himanshu0811:~/gitty/gitty$ git log
fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'

Can be seen when there is no initial commit
